# sqlitemoviedatabase
that's my half finished partly school & partly fun project. it's working but still not look like as i imagined it.

first tab:
  moviedatabase.java is the where app start with. if there is no database file it will ask user to create a new one(according to internal sql lines in the file, i am not so sure that this is the rght way but it's working). and after you run the program there will be a table on top for listing movies in database. u can click to add button to add a movie. u can fill the movie info manually or u can use 'imdb id' of the movie to fetch movie info automatically(thanks to jsoup library!). few seconds of wait and voila!, all the empty places filled out. plus u have nie big poster of the movie. and then u can save this.
when u click a row, program will show additional information that u have in your database(actors, directors, poster, imdb links and other stuff etc.).

second tab:
  u can search by sql commands from searchfield or u can use various filters at boottom.

ps: i am aware of that there are a lots things need to be done. but thats how far i could came so far. and also there are lots of unneccessary files and lines. need a cleaning. dont have time unfortunately.
